## ovoplayer-webremote is a cross-browser web GUI for my [ovoplayer](https://github.com/varianus/ovoplayer) audio player.

It's developed as a single page web app, using only [skeleton](www.getskeleton.com), one of the lightest framework, and pure javascript code (NO jquery).
This web app do not need any hosting or server application, just copy the repository content on some folder of your file system and point your browser to index.html.

#### Note: Communication with ovoplayer is done via websocket protocol. Actually this is implemented only on development version (>= 1.4) of ovoplayer. Note also that [net communication protocol](https://github.com/varianus/ovoplayer/wiki/NetProtocol) is also under development and not stable.
